/**
 * Background shells — commands that outlive the tool call that started them.
 *
 * A foreground bash run is bounded by a timeout because an unbounded one is
 * INVISIBLE: the bug this guards against is a forgotten command still running
 * thirty minutes later with nothing on screen saying so. Backgrounding trades
 * that bound for visibility — every shell here is listed in the shells panel
 * and reachable through the `shells` tool, so it can run as long as it needs.
 *
 * Ownership is the session's, not the turn's: aborting a turn (esc) must not
 * kill a dev server the user asked for. The bound that remains is the process:
 * shells are registered in memory, never persisted, and killed on exit. A
 * resumed session in a new process does NOT adopt the old one's children —
 * adopting an orphan tree means owning reaping and authorization, and a
 * half-owned process tree is worse than none. (opencode reached the same
 * conclusion from the other direction: their background launch is gated behind
 * "persist job status and define restart recovery" for exactly this reason.)
 *
 * Output goes to a file from byte zero rather than through OutputAccumulator.
 * The accumulator keeps a bounded tail, which is right for a run you are
 * waiting on and wrong for one you poll: a dev server can log for an hour
 * between reads, and the interesting part is what arrived SINCE the last read.
 * A file gives that as an offset, costs no memory, and hands the user a path
 * they can tail themselves.
 *
 * Those writes are SYNCHRONOUS. A WriteStream buffers, and the first thing
 * anyone does with a new shell is read it — the tool call that starts one
 * literally says "read it with shells" — so a buffered write means the first
 * read comes back empty and the output looks lost. Writing through the fd
 * keeps the byte counter and the file exactly equal at all times, which is
 * what makes an offset read trustworthy.
