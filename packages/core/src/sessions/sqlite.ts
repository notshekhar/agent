/**
 * The SQLite handle, for whichever runtime core is running in.
 *
 * Core was written against `bun:sqlite`, which is right for the CLI — it ships
 * inside `bun build --compile` with WAL and needs no native module. But core is
 * a *library*, and the desktop app wants to use it from Electron's main
 * process, which is Node. `bun:sqlite` does not exist there.
 *
 * MEASURED (Electron 40 = Node 24.15): `node:sqlite` is built in and covers
 * everything core actually uses — `prepare`, `all`, `get`, `run`, `iterate`,
 * and both the WAL and foreign-key pragmas. Only two things are missing, and
 * both are Bun sugar rather than SQLite features:
 *
 *   - `db.query(sql)` — a prepared statement with a cache in front of it.
 *   - `db.transaction(fn)` — a callable that wraps `fn` in BEGIN/COMMIT.
 *
 * So this is an adapter, not an abstraction: **under Bun the real
 * `bun:sqlite` Database is handed back untouched**, so the CLI's behaviour —
 * including corruption recovery and every timing characteristic — is
 * bit-for-bit what it was. Only Node gets a wrapper, and the wrapper exists
 * solely to add those two methods.
 *
 * The specifier is computed rather than written literally, so neither
 * bundler tries to resolve the other runtime's builtin at build time. Both
 * modules are runtime builtins (nothing to bundle), which is why this survives
 * `bun build --compile`.
