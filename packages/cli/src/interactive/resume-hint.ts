 * resume is already sitting in your scrollback the moment you want it, which
 * is exactly when you have just closed the thing you needed.

/**
 * Write the resume command to stdout. Call AFTER the TUI has stopped — the
 * alternate screen is gone by then, so this lands in the terminal's own
 * scrollback and survives the exit.
 *
 * Silent when there is no session: an unsaved conversation (no model picked,
 * nothing sent) has no id to resume by, and printing a command that cannot
 * work is worse than printing nothing. Silent too when stdout is not a
 * terminal, so the line never lands in a pipe that expects only real output.
