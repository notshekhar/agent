/**
 * What a finished tool call actually RETURNED, in one line.
 *
 * A row like `◆ read src/app.ts` says what was asked for and nothing about
 * what came back — which is fine in a mode that shows the output underneath,
 * and is the whole problem in one that folds it away. The receipt is the
 * missing half: `580 lines`, `exit 1 · 214 lines`, `+12 −4 · 2 blocks`. Enough
 * that a scrolled-back transcript reads as a record of what happened rather
 * than a list of what was attempted.
 *
 * Pure and uncoloured, like {@link formatToolArgs} beside it — callers apply
 * the theme, and the same text serves any surface that wants it (a noir row, a
 * folded group's member line, a /tree entry).
 *
 * Every rule here reads a tool's REAL result text, whose shapes are set in
 * packages/core/src/tools. Two conventions recur and are worth naming once:
 *
 * - a trailing bracketed notice (`[Showing lines 1-500 of 2000. …]`) after a
 *   blank line, which read/grep/ls/bash all append and none of which is body;
 * - a `summary` line followed by a diff, for edit/write, split on a blank line
 *   (`DIFF_SEPARATOR`) so the model can be shown only the head.
 *
 * When a rule can't read what it expected it returns "" rather than guess. A
 * missing receipt costs a glance at the expanded output; a wrong one is a lie
 * the transcript now tells every time it is scrolled past.
 *
 * The second half of the file is the PEEK: the few lines of real output a
 * folded row shows under its receipt. A receipt says how much came back; the
 * peek says what it was.
