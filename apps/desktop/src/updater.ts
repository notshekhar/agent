 * builds are ad-hoc signed (`codesign` reports `adhoc`, no TeamIdentifier). The
 * same is true of electron-updater. So this does what `install-desktop.sh`
 * already does, in-process: resolve the latest release, download the platform's
 * asset, check it against the published sha256, and swap the installed copy.
 *
 * The whole module is written against injected `fetch`/`run`/paths rather than
 * reaching for globals, because the risky half — replacing a directory that the
 * running program lives in — is only trustworthy if a test can drive it against
 * a fake install tree. Nothing here touches Electron; `main.ts` owns that seam.
