/**
 * Package the desktop app into a distributable per platform.
 *
 * `build.ts` produces the app's own files (main, preload, renderer, and the
 * loop binary it spawns). This wraps those in an Electron runtime and emits a
 * single archive the installer can fetch:
 *
 *     bun package-app.ts                 # host platform
 *     bun package-app.ts darwin-arm64    # a specific target
 *
 * Output: release/loop-desktop-<platform>-<arch>.{zip,tar.gz}
 *
 * Packaging runs from a STAGING directory rather than this one. Electron
 * packager copies the app folder as-is, and bun's node_modules is a tree of
 * symlinks into a content-addressed store — copying that verbatim ships
 * dangling links. Staging is also what lets the bundled loop binary be the
 * TARGET's rather than the host's, which is the whole point of cross-packaging.
